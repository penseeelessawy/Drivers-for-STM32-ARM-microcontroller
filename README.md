This repository contains a comprehensive collection of STM32 drivers implemented from scratch using datasheets as references. The drivers are designed to provide efficient and reliable control over various peripheral modules of STM32 microcontrollers STM32 Drivers Welcome to the STM32 Drivers repository! This repository contains a collection of STM32 drivers implemented from scratch using datasheets as references. These drivers provide efficient and reliable control over various peripheral modules of STM32 microcontrollers.

Usage Each driver in this repository comes with a set of functions and examples to demonstrate its usage. You can find the usage instructions and examples in the respective driver directories. Refer to the driver-specific documentation for detailed information on how to integrate and use the drivers in your projects.

Drivers This repository includes drivers for the following peripheral modules: GPIO UART SPI I2C ADC PWM Timers RCC For each driver, you can find the implementation details, usage guidelines, and examples in their respective directories.

Simulation This repository also includes simulation files using Proteus to verify and test the functionality of the drivers. The simulation files can be found in the Simulation directory. Follow the instructions in the simulation documentation to set up and run the simulations.
